# Data Exploration

The choice of hypothesis space ```H``` heavily relies on the assumptions made about the data. A common mistake is to favor a particular type of function, such as Neural Networks, without considering the characteristics of the data. Each machine learning algorithm operates under different assumptions about the data, and these assumptions influence the probability it generates. Therefore, it's essential to select the algorithm that best aligns with the assumptions inherent in the data. By understanding these underlying assumptions and choosing the appropriate algorithm accordingly, we increase the likelihood of constructing a model that accurately captures the data's patterns and produces reliable predictions.

Data Exploration is thus a fundamental step in the machine learning pipeline that aids in understanding the characteristics and underlying patterns within the data. Through data exploration techniques such as statistical analysis, visualization, and feature engineering, we gain insights into various aspects of the data, including its distribution, correlations, and outliers.

Some particular features to observe in data are:

* The properties of the data, such as schema and statistical properties
* The quality of the data, like missing values and inconsistent data types
* The predictive power of the data, such as correlation of features against target

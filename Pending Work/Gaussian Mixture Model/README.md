## Introduction

The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a probabilistic model for clustering. Unlike K-Means algorithm which associates each point with a specific cluster, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a more flexible probabilistic approach to clustering, where each data point is assigned a probability of belonging to each cluster.

## Assumptions

The main assumptions of GMM are that the data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions, with each distribution having its own parameters (mean, covariance), and each data point can belong to more than one cluster with varying degrees of membership.

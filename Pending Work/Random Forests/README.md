# Random Forests

Random Forests are specific type of bagging applied to decision trees. 

K = sqrt(f)

## Algorithm

There are two things
first we have to train every decision tree till last
second we have to randomly select feature search for splitting in K where K is less than F. generally it is sqrt(f)
